### About task

Test task at the JS courses for beginners.
<p>* This is my first JS script. So there are no refactoring, no JS best practices, no class usages, ect.

### Instruments:
- JavaScript (+HTML)


###<a> How to start: <br>
<a>1. Copy files `test.html` and `myscript.js` into the same folder.</a>

<a>2. Run `test.html` in the browser.</a>

<a>3. To run the script again refresh the page in the browser (autostart of the script unable due to the requirements).</a>

4. Alternatively, you can run `test.html` directly from the IDE (tested in PyCharm): right-click on the mouse -> Open in -> Browser -> (choose browser OR "Build-in Preview")
